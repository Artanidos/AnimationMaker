	A few month ago I raised a crowd funding campaign for the AnimationMaker but was not able to collect a cent.
	Then I decided to continue without a budget.
	To be able to support the AnimationMaker and to develop it further I need a budget, so I decided to also release
	commercial licenses for Windows and MacOS.
	And therefore I have to register my company and I also need a small budget to survive.
